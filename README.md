### About transformer models

It seems that in-script hf model downloading has been restricted recently, please download the files manually and place them into {project dir}/models/{model name}

- please also edit the value of **embedding_model_name** in {project dir}/configs/common.py, which to be same with {model name}

- my preference: [simcse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08821)
